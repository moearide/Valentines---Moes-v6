# 💘 Valentine Interactive Site

A playful interactive Valentine webpage where:

- The **No button runs away**
- The **Yes button gets bigger**
- The page asks “Are you sure?” multiple times
- The Yes button chases your cursor/finger (magnet effect)
- Confetti explodes when Yes is clicked
- Floating hearts animate in the background
- A final message appears: “I knew you’d say yes ❤️”

Built as a fun, shareable micro-site.
